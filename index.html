    <p>Tig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for git. It functions mainly 
      as a Git repository browser, but can also assist in staging changes for commit at 
      chunk level and act as a pager for output from various Git commands.

      A change for the better.

      <p class="life">
        If I could write just one meaningful thing in my tiny and insignificant life.
        Just one thing to help bring love, change or hope.
        Would that justify my existence?
        Would it right the wrongs committed in the name of just continuing on?
        If so, would it do so, because life has no "fair", or would it be because certain acts can outweigh others?
        Who decides?
